# Mx-CRTSA
The source code for our paper "Discovering Community Structure in Multiplex Networks via a Co-Regularized Robust Tensor-Based Spectral Approach".

Available [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/13/4/2514).

# Required toolboxes:
The MATLAB code for MV-RTSC needs some toolboxes:

[1] Tensor decomposition, Xie, Y., Tao, D., Zhang, W., Liu, Y., Zhang, L., & Qu, Y. (2018). 
"On unifying multi-view self-representations for clustering by tensor multi-rank minimization."

[2] Tensor Toolbox for MATLAB: <a href="https://www.tensortoolbox.org">www.tensortoolbox.org</a>

# Data set:
All datasets used in our paper are available at Google Drive. Each dataset is a mat file containing 2 variables including adgacancy tensor and ground truth of the network. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1T8AITuQZCbCB52PELprIVb75d4-6hi20
